we are given 2D coordinates of following points (0,1), (2,4), (3,6), and (7,7).

1. Store following data in python and write a function to determint distance between two points.
2. Write a function to estimate polar coordinate of any point.
3. Write a function that moves point and determines new position when movement is given
